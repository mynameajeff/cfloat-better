# cfloat-better
A simple attempt at making arrays a little easier to work with in C. 

A documentation of sorts can be found in `documentation/some-explanations.md`.

In that same directory, there is `example.c`, which showcases the various functions being used.

The Makefile is made to generate an executable of that file.
